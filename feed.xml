AWS re:Invent 2024 was a total blast, and I’m still buzzing from all the amazing things I saw and learned. As you know, I’m passionate about data and AI, so I was especially excited to see how AWS is pushing the boundaries in these areas. Let me tell you, they didn’t disappoint!</p> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/reinvent-2024-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/reinvent-2024-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/reinvent-2024-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/reinvent-2024.jpeg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <h1 id="data-maturity-the-foundation-for-success">Data Maturity: The Foundation for Success</h1> <p>First things first, data maturity: It’s the key to unlocking the true potential of your data. Think about it: if your data is siloed, inconsistent, or just plain hard to access, you’re missing out on valuable insights that could help you better serve your customers, optimize your operations, and drive innovation.</p> <p>As I’ve been saying in my talks this last year (2024), data maturity is a must if you want to extract the most value from the IA in your business. Once the hype passes, we engineers need to build and deploy a lot of infrastructure and software to extract value from this innotation. I like when Dave Shapiro says that our current situation is akin to send a jet engine back in time 100 years: they will need to build a lot of things around it to make sense and get value from it.</p> <p>At re:Invent, AWS made it clear that they’re serious about helping businesses achieve data maturity. They announced a ton of new services and features designed to make it easier to manage, integrate, and govern your data. Here are a few highlights:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Amazon S3 Metadata:</strong> This new feature lets you tag your data with all sorts of labels, making it super easy to find and classify. Plus, it helps you boost your security posture by making it clear what data you have and where it’s stored.</li> <li><strong>Zero-ETL Integrations:</strong> Say goodbye to the headaches of ETL! With these new integrations, you can connect your tools (like Zendesk and SAP) directly to Redshift, making data analysis a breeze.</li> <li>Amazon DataZone and AWS Glue: These services work together to ensure your data is accurate, consistent, and trustworthy. No more worrying about making decisions based on bad data!</li> <li><strong>Amazon OpenSearch Service and Amazon Security Lake Integration:</strong> Security teams, rejoice! This integration makes it easier and faster to detect and respond to threats, keeping your data safe and sound.</li> </ul> <h1 id="ai-the-next-frontier">AI: The Next Frontier</h1> <p>Now, let’s talk about AI. Generative AI was the talk of the show, and AWS is leading the charge in making it accessible to everyone. They announced a bunch of new tools and services that make it easier than ever to build and deploy AI-powered applications.</p> <p>Here are some of the things that blew my mind:</p> <ul> <li>Amazon Nova: This suite of generative AI models lets you create text, images, and videos with incredible ease. Imagine being able to generate marketing materials or product demos in minutes!</li> <li>Amazon Bedrock Model Distillation: This is a game-changer for AI efficiency. It lets you create smaller, faster, and more cost-effective models that are optimized for specific tasks.</li> <li>Enhanced Amazon SageMaker: SageMaker is already a powerful platform for AI development, but now it’s even better. It’s a one-stop shop for data engineering, analytics, and generative AI, making it easier than ever to integrate AI into your workflows.</li> <li>AWS Trainium2 and Trainium3: These new instances deliver unmatched performance for AI/ML workloads, so you can train and deploy your models faster than ever before.</li> </ul> <h1 id="my-key-takeaways">My key takeaways</h1> <p>Mostly what I think can be used immediately, services to use and ideas to start having now:</p> <h2 id="simplexity-making-the-complex-simple">Simplexity: Making the Complex Simple</h2> <p>One of the coolest concepts I heard at re:Invent was “simplexity.” It’s all about making complex systems easier to manage by offloading the complexity to AWS’s infrastructure. This means you can focus on what you do best: innovating and building awesome things. While the concept is not new, hearing it from The Man itself had a different path to my neurons, it “clicked” differently and allowed me to think like an industry trailblazer, give me wings to dream big and find my vision and place in the future.</p> <h2 id="amazon-connect-ai-powered-customer-service">Amazon Connect: AI-Powered Customer Service</h2> <p>Amazon Connect got a major upgrade with a bunch of new AI-powered features. These include things like generative AI for segmentation and campaigns, WhatsApp Business integration, and enhanced analytics. Basically, it’s everything you need to deliver amazing customer experiences.</p> <h2 id="aws-education-equity-initiative-ai-for-everyone">AWS Education Equity Initiative: AI for Everyone</h2> <p>I was really impressed by AWS’s commitment to responsible AI development. They announced a $100 million investment in the AWS Education Equity Initiative, which will help underserved students gain valuable AI and cloud computing skills.</p> <h2 id="amazon-q-developer-agent-your-ai-coding-buddy">Amazon Q Developer Agent: Your AI Coding Buddy</h2> <p>This is a developer’s dream come true! The Amazon Q developer agent is an AI-powered tool that can help you with all sorts of coding tasks, like generating documentation, performing code reviews, and building unit tests. It’s like having a super-smart coding buddy by your side.</p> <h1 id="reinvent-highlights-so-much-to-see-and-do">re:Invent Highlights: So Much to See and Do</h1> <p>There were so many amazing sessions and events at re:Invent, it was hard to choose my favorites. But here are a few that I found particularly interesting:</p> <ul> <li>AI-enhanced media archives: Classify, discover, and monetize: This session showed how AI can be used to make media archives more useful and valuable.</li> <li>Building secure generative AI Solutions using OWASP principles: This bootcamp was a must-attend for anyone interested in building secure AI applications.</li> </ul> <h1 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h1> <p>AWS re:Invent 2024 was an incredible experience. It was packed with innovation, excitement, and a whole lot of learning. I’m more convinced than ever that data maturity and AI are the keys to success in the years to come. I STRONGLY recommend you to attend at least one in your life.</p> <p>I hope this recap has given you a taste of what re:Invent was all about. If you’re interested in learning more, I encourage you to check out the official AWS re:Invent website and the many blog posts and articles that have been written about the event.</p> <p>I’ll be also sharing my more personal experience in a separate blog post some time this january.</p> <p>Cheers!</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="event"/><category term="aws"/><category term="experience"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[What I learnt about the future of the world of data and AI from re:Invent 2024]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">My twitter/X posts</title><link href="https://cjbarroso.github.io/blog/2024/twitter/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="My twitter/X posts"/><published>2024-12-28T15:12:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-12-28T15:12:00+00:00</updated><id>https://cjbarroso.github.io/blog/2024/twitter</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cjbarroso.github.io/blog/2024/twitter/"><![CDATA[<h1 id="highlighted-tweet">Highlighted Tweet</h1> <div class="jekyll-twitter-plugin"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">are we on the early days of the singularity?</p>&mdash; Carlos José Barroso (@cjbarroso) <a href="https://twitter.com/cjbarroso/status/1870263642651812036?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2024</a></blockquote> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </div> <h1 id="timeline">Timeline</h1> <div class="jekyll-twitter-plugin"><a class="twitter-timeline" data-width="500" data-tweet-limit="3" href="https://twitter.com/cjbarroso?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Tweets by cjbarroso</a> <script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> </div>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="sample-posts"/><category term="external-services"/><category term="formatting"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My X feed]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">AI: Beyond Science Fiction - A Look at Its Gradual Takeover</title><link href="https://cjbarroso.github.io/blog/2024/ai-beyond-science-fiction-a-look-at-its-gradual-takeover/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="AI: Beyond Science Fiction - A Look at Its Gradual Takeover"/><published>2024-07-08T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2024-07-08T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://cjbarroso.github.io/blog/2024/ai-beyond-science-fiction---a-look-at-its-gradual-takeover</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://cjbarroso.github.io/blog/2024/ai-beyond-science-fiction-a-look-at-its-gradual-takeover/"><![CDATA[]]></content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html"><![CDATA[From finance to healthcare, AI is revolutionizing every aspect of our lives.
