Hey there! 👋

This is a post about a super cool event that happened yesterday, October 3rd, in beautiful Buenos Aires, Argentina! I had the awesome opportunity to give a talk titled "From Idea to GenAI" at the Amazon Web Services (AWS) offices, and it was a blast! 🥳

We dove deep into the exciting world of Generative AI (or #IAGenerativa, as we call it in Spanish!), exploring how to transform those brilliant ideas into tangible realities. We also got a firsthand look at the incredible value that #IA is bringing to businesses today. It was truly inspiring! ✨

A huge shoutout and thank you to @amazonwebservices for hosting us and for creating such a welcoming space for this insightful conversation! 🙏 And of course, thank you to everyone who joined us—your enthusiasm and participation made it all the more special! We are definitely eager to keep the conversation going and explore even more possibilities of Generative AI. We think there is a lot of growing together we can do! 🤝​

As proud partners of AWS, we're absolutely confident that together we can take Generative AI to the next level. The time is now to unlock its full potential! 🦾✅​

Let's build the future together! 🚀
