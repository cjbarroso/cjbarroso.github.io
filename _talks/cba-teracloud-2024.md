# From Idea to GenAI - Nov 13th, 2024. Cordoba, Argentina

My FITGA talk at Teracloud's offices in Cordoba, Argentina.

Check out the pics and a bit about my talk! ðŸ“¸

Tera-Workshop: Supercharge your startup with #GenerativeAI ðŸŒŸ

As #Teraclouders, we're dedicated to bringing the latest tech trends to our community. That's why we gathered at our offices for a hands-on workshop on how #startups can begin leveraging generative AI in their projects. It was led by @carlosjosebarroso, our #HeadofAI with 20+ years of experience! ðŸ¦¾

Big thanks to everyone who joined us! We know #GenerativeAI can seem complex, so our goal is to make it understandable and usable for anyone who wants to unleash its potential.

Missed it? Don't worry, there'll be more events coming soon! Keep an eye on our website to find out everything we're doing to make tech accessible to everyone. ðŸŒŽðŸš€  We're all about making the magic of AI within reach! âœ¨ Don't miss out next time! ðŸ˜‰
