Tera-Workshop: Supercharge your startup with #GenerativeAI 🌟

As #Teraclouders, we're dedicated to bringing the latest tech trends to our community. That's why we gathered at our offices for a hands-on workshop on how #startups can begin leveraging generative AI in their projects. It was led by @carlosjosebarroso, our #HeadofAI with 20+ years of experience! 🦾

Big thanks to everyone who joined us! We know #GenerativeAI can seem complex, so our goal is to make it understandable and usable for anyone who wants to unleash its potential.
