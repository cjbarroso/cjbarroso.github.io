## What I Do

I work at the intersection of AI, cloud, and innovation.
I help organizations design data platforms, deploy intelligent systems, and build internal capacity to scale with confidence.

## Services

- 💡 **AI & Strategy:** Define your AI roadmap, validate opportunities, and design responsible AI governance frameworks that align with real business outcomes.
- ☁️ **Cloud & Data Architecture:** Modernize your data stack: AWS, Redshift, S3, Lake Formation, Iceberg — secure, cost-optimized, and ready for analytics and AI.
- 🤖 **Generative AI & Agents:** Build custom Bedrock, Anthropic, or OpenAI-based agents. Integrate them with APIs, knowledge bases, and workflows that matter.
  🧭 **Innovation Labs & Product Incubation:** From hypothesis to MVP: I help organizations structure, test, and launch new products using lean, product-management principles.
- 🧱 **Technical Advisory:** Code and architecture reviews, mentoring for data teams, and hands-on support for complex technical decisions.

## Who I Work With

Startups, enterprises, and consulting teams that want to accelerate with clarity — not chaos.
Education and social-impact projects welcome, too.
