## What I Do

I work at the intersection of AI, cloud, and innovation.
I help organizations design data platforms, deploy intelligent systems, and build internal capacity to scale with confidence.

## Services

- 💡 **AI & Strategy:** Define your AI roadmap, validate opportunities, and design responsible AI governance frameworks that align with real business outcomes.
