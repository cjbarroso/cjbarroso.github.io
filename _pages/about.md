Iâ€™m Carlos J. Barroso â€” an AI specialist, data architect, and builder of ideas that work.
For over a decade, Iâ€™ve helped teams and organizations turn data into intelligence and AI into business value. I design systems that donâ€™t just run â€” they learn, adapt, and scale.

My work spans AWS, Google Cloud, and on-premise data and AI platforms, always focused on creating architectures that are reliable, cost-efficient, and ready for growth. Whether itâ€™s shaping multi-account data lakes, deploying AI agents, or structuring innovation labs, I focus on solving real problems â€” the kind that move both technology and business forward.

Beyond tech, Iâ€™m a musician â€” I sing, and play classical guitar and bass. Music keeps me grounded in rhythm, patience, and flow â€” qualities that show up in my engineering work too.
I also love trekking through the Andes near my home and training with kettlebells, finding in both the same mix of challenge and clarity that drives my professional life.

At heart, Iâ€™m curious â€” about how systems work, how people learn, and how small experiments compound into transformation.
If youâ€™re building something ambitious, or just want to talk about the intersection of AI, data, and human creativity, letâ€™s connect.
